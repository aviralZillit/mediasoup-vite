📜 Full Ordered List of Events (Client-Server Communication in Video Call)

Here’s a detailed breakdown of the WebRTC video call flow based on your logs, with the exact sequence of events between the client and server.

⸻

📌 1️⃣ Client Establishes Connection
	1.	Client requests router capabilities:
getRouterRtpCapabilities → (Client → Server)
	•	Client asks for supported codecs from the mediasoup router.
	2.	Server responds with capabilities:
mediasoup-version → (Server → Client)
	•	Server notifies the client about the Mediasoup version (3.15.2).
	3.	Server sends router capabilities:
getRouterRtpCapabilities (response) → (Server → Client)
	•	Server sends a list of available codecs (Opus, VP8, VP9, H264, etc.) and RTP header extensions.

⸻

📌 2️⃣ Client Creates WebRTC Transports
	4.	Client creates transport for sending media:
createWebRtcTransport (producing) → (Client → Server)
	•	The client sets up a transport to send audio/video.
	5.	Server responds with transport details:
createWebRtcTransport (response) → (Server → Client)
	•	Server provides ICE candidates, DTLS parameters, and SCTP settings.
	6.	Client creates transport for receiving media:
createWebRtcTransport (consuming) → (Client → Server)
	•	The client sets up a separate transport to receive media.
	7.	Server responds with details:
createWebRtcTransport (response) → (Server → Client)
	•	Server provides ICE candidates and DTLS parameters.

⸻

📌 3️⃣ Client Joins the Room
	8.	Client sends join request:
join → (Client → Server)
	•	Client joins the room, sending display name, device details, RTP capabilities.
	9.	Server responds with existing peers:
join (response) → (Server → Client)
	•	Server provides a list of already connected peers.

⸻

📌 4️⃣ Media Subscription (Receiving Other Peers’ Media)
	10.	Server sends audio stream details:
newConsumer (audio) → (Server → Client)

	•	Server informs the client about an existing audio producer.

	11.	Server sends video stream details:
newConsumer (video) → (Server → Client)

	•	Server informs the client about an existing video producer.

	12.	Server sends data channel details:
newDataConsumer (chat) → (Server → Client)

	•	Server informs the client about an existing data producer (chat messages).

⸻

📌 5️⃣ WebRTC Transport Connection
	13.	Client connects receive transport:
connectWebRtcTransport (receive) → (Client → Server)

	•	Client connects the receiving transport using DTLS parameters.

	14.	Client connects send transport:
connectWebRtcTransport (send) → (Client → Server)

	•	Client connects the sending transport.

	15.	Server confirms transport connections:
connectWebRtcTransport (response) → (Server → Client)

	•	Server confirms both send and receive transports are connected.

⸻

📌 6️⃣ Client Starts Sending Media
	16.	Client starts sending audio:
produce (audio) → (Client → Server)

	•	Client begins sending an audio stream.

	17.	Server notifies other peers:
activeSpeaker → (Server → Client)

	•	Server detects that a peer started speaking (peerId: "glmsxb1h", volume: -42).

⸻

📌 7️⃣ Dynamic Call Updates
	18.	Server updates producer quality:
producerScore → (Server → Client)

	•	Reports encoding performance and quality.

	19.	Server adjusts bandwidth:
downlinkBwe → (Server → Client)

	•	Server adjusts bitrate based on network conditions.

	20.	Server pauses a consumer:
consumerPaused → (Server → Client)

	•	Server pauses a media stream for one of the peers.

	21.	Server detects no active speakers:
activeSpeaker → (Server → Client)

	•	No one is speaking.

⸻

📌 8️⃣ Call Ends (Client Leaves)
	22.	Server notifies peer disconnection:
peerClosed → (Server → Client)

	•	A peer left the call.

	23.	Client stops media streaming:
closeProducer → (Client → Server)

	•	Client stops sending media.

	24.	Client disconnects from transport:
deleteWebRtcTransport → (Client → Server)

	•	WebRTC transports are closed.

🚀 What This Flow Shows

✅ Connection Establishment: The client retrieves RTP capabilities and creates transports.
✅ Room Join & Peer Discovery: The client joins the room and receives existing peers.
✅ Media Streaming: The client sends audio/video, and the server distributes it.
✅ Dynamic Bandwidth Handling: The server adjusts bitrate and manages network changes.
✅ Call End Process: Peers leave the room, and transports are closed.
