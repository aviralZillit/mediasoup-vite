## 🎯 Live Call Monitoring Features

### What You Can See During Live Calls:

#### **Real-time Metrics** 📊
```
✅ Current participants in each room
✅ Active producers (cameras, microphones, screen shares)
✅ Active consumers (who's receiving what)
✅ Connection quality scores (1-5 rating)
✅ Bitrate, packet loss, frame rate
✅ Server performance (CPU, memory)
```

#### **Consumer Drop Detection** 🚨
```
✅ Instant alerts when any consumer drops
✅ Reason for disconnection (network, error, etc.)
✅ Which room and participant affected
✅ Connection quality degradation warnings
✅ Historical drop patterns and analysis
```

#### **Live Dashboard Views** 📈
```
✅ Server Overview: Total rooms, peers, uptime
✅ Active Rooms: Real-time room statistics
✅ Connection Quality: Live quality scores per peer
✅ Alert Feed: Real-time issue notifications
✅ Resource Monitoring: Server health metrics
```

## 🚦 How to Start Your Production System

### Quick Start (Development)
```bash
cd server

# Install dependencies
npm install

# Start MediaSoup server
npm start

# Start monitoring dashboard (in separate terminal)
npm run monitor
```

### Production Start (Recommended)
```bash
cd server

# Start both services with monitoring
./start-production.sh
```

### Access Points
- **MediaSoup Server**: http://localhost:3000
- **Monitoring Dashboard**: http://localhost:8080
- **Analytics API**: http://localhost:3000/analytics/*

## 📊 API Endpoints for Analytics

### Server Analytics
```bash
GET /analytics/server          # Server overview & stats
GET /analytics/rooms           # All rooms analytics
GET /analytics/rooms/:roomId   # Specific room details
GET /analytics/rooms/:roomId/peers/:peerId  # Peer analytics
```

### Real-time Monitoring
```bash
GET /api/metrics              # Current system metrics
GET /api/alerts               # Active alerts
GET /api/rooms/:roomId        # Live room data
```

## 🔍 Consumer Drop Detection in Action

### What Triggers Alerts:
1. **Transport Disconnection**: Network issues or client crashes
2. **Consumer Close Events**: Explicit consumer termination
3. **Quality Degradation**: Connection quality drops below threshold
4. **Error Patterns**: High error rates indicating problems

### Alert Information Provided:
```json
{
  "type": "CONSUMER_DROP",
  "severity": "high",
  "message": "Consumer dropped in room room123: Network timeout",
  "roomId": "room123",
  "peerId": "peer456",
  "timestamp": 1645123456789,
  "reason": "transport-closed"
}
```

## 🐳 Docker Production Deployment

### Build & Run
```bash
# Build production image
docker build -t mediasoup-production .

# Run with all services
docker run -d \
  --name mediasoup-server \
  -p 3000:3000 \
  -p 8080:8080 \
  -p 40000-40100:40000-40100/udp \
  -e MEDIASOUP_ANNOUNCED_IP=your.server.ip \
  mediasoup-production
```
